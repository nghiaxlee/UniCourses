                <p>        I love movies about the Internet. As someone who has grown up just as much on the web as off it, I feel as if it’s my virtual home, and inherently connect to films with social networks or hacking or viral media as major plot points perhaps more than films about any other subject.These movies thematically explore different aspects of the web, revealing both the positive and negative affects of living in such a connected world.</p>

                <p><abbr title="Internet Movie Database">IMDb's</abbr> rating 7.7/10</p>
                <p>        Harvard student <b>Mark Zuckerberg</b> creates the social networking site that would become known as <b>Facebook</b>, but is later sued by two brothers who claimed he stole their idea, and the co-founder who was later squeezed out of the business.</p>
                <p>        The Social Network" is a great film not because of its dazzling style or visual cleverness, but because it is splendidly well-made. Despite the baffling complications of computer programming, web strategy and big finance, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay makes it all clear, and we don't follow the story so much as get dragged along behind it.</p>

                <p><abbr title="Internet Movie Database">IMDb's</abbr> rating 8/10</p>
                <p>        In a near future, a lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with an operating systemdesigned to meet his every need.</p>
                <p>        It's touching and funny and thought provoking and compelling and the music is a perfect partner to the picture. This is bravura filmmaking, risking all on trusting the instinct of a writer and the ability to create a complex, fascinating persona that the audience never sees. But we do feel her.</p>

                <p><abbr title="Internet Movie Database">IMDb's</abbr> rating 7,1/10</p>
                <p>        Deep Web is a 2015 documentary film directed by Alex Winter, chronicling events surrounding Silk Road, bitcoin and politics of the dark web.</p>
                <p>        Director Alex Winter does a great job of delving into the underworld of the internet and the intrica cies of the Silk Road case, it’s just a shame it’s not a more rounded view, as you can’t help but feel there’s another side to the case you’re not being told about.</p>
